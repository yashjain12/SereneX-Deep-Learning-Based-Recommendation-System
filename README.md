Uses Microsoft Recommenders and implements a Neural Network for Collaborative Filtering to create a Recommender System.

Neural collaborative filtering (NCF) is a supercharged advanced collaborative filtering method using neural networks. In matrix factorization, the user-item relationship is defined through the inner product of user and item matrices. In NCF, this inner product is replaced by a neural network structure. Through this, it tries to achieve two things:

* Generalize the matrix factorization into a neural network framework
* Learn the user-item interactions/relationship through a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
